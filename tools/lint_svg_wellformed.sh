# Strict XML well-formedness lint for every TRACKED *.svg in the repo.
#
# Why this exists: this storefront shipped (in PR #25, since fixed) a favicon
# ported with a literal "--" inside an XML comment — which XML 1.0 §2.5 forbids.
# Browsers render such files fine, so the defect was LATENT, but strict parsers
# (expat, rsvg-convert, resvg) refuse them outright. One favicon rasteriser away
# from live. This lint fails CI on any malformed tracked SVG so it cannot recur.
#
# Coverage is `git ls-files '*.svg'` ON PURPOSE — it picks up ANY .svg added
# anywhere in the tree, automatically. Do NOT hand-scope it to the directories
# we happen to remember today: a new asset elsewhere would then slip past, and
# that blind-spot is exactly the class of bug we have been closing.
#
# The parser is Python's expat (via xml.dom.minidom) — the same class of strict
# parser that refused the shipped file — so "green here" means a strict SVG
# consumer will accept every tracked asset.
